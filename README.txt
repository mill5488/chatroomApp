Directions for using (and testing) my project:

To build my project, 
1. Extract from the Archive
1. Get to the directory where these files are located within a shell. (will need to go inside the directory that is immediately extracted from the archive)
2. run < make >
3. Let Makefile build the project.

To run the project,
4. Get inside of the directory where the executables are located within a shell. (Can be the same as you ran make with)

5. run < java Server inputfile.txt > where inputfile.txt is any .txt file that follows the structure of the users.txt file. 
This means a file wherein the file is a .txt file where each line follows the structure: userName,Password with a simple , between them. 

6. Get inside of the directory where the executables are located within a SEPERATE shell.
7. run < java Client > 

8. Repeat steps 6 -> 7 for more Clients.
